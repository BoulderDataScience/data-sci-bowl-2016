1. Create a fork of this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right. 
   This will create an exact copy of the repo in your Github user account.

2. Clone your new repo

      git clone https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git

    "git status" should now say you are on the master branch

        => git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
        nothing to commit, working directory clean

    "git remote -v" should show an "origin" remote with the url of your 
    forked repo.


        | => git remote -v
            origin  https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git (fetch)
            origin  https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git (push)

    
3. Make local modifications. Once you make changes, running "git status" will show that the files you have modified, added, and/or deleted.

    | => git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        docs/

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track


4. Add the files to be commited with the following command:

   git add file_1 path/to/file_2 

   git status will now show these ready for commit

  

    | => git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

    new file:   docs/howto_git_pr.txt  
    

5. commit the files that have been added from the previous step with
   git commit -m "An informative message about the commit"

    | => git commit -m "added git pr howto doc"
    [master 3c00e9e] added git pr howto doc
     1 file changed, 44 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 docs/howto_git_pr.txt

6. push your changes back to your forked repo with "git push origin master"


    Note: Because I have multiple github user accounts, the push tried to use my work account.  This failed as my work account does not have write access to my personal fork repo:

        | => git push origin master
        remote: Permission to blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git denied to tlewis11.
        fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

    To get around this, I had to push to the origin.url manually and specify my username in the url:

        | => git push https://blank-blank@github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git master
        Password for 'https://blank-blank@github.com':

7. Navigate to the forked repo on Github
8. Click "New Pull Requst"
9. Ensure that base fork is the master branch of the Boulder Data Science repo for the Kaggle competition and that the head fork is the master branch of the forked repo that you pushed to in step 6.
10. Click "Create Pull Request" and then fill in appropriate fields.
11. Inform admins in slack channel.  Once an admin merges the pull request, your code will be in the master repo for the Boulder Data Science Kaggle competition.
