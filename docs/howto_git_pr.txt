1. Create a fork of this repo by clicking the fork button in the top right. 
   This will create an exact copy of the repo in your Github user account.

2. Clone your new repo

      git clone https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git

    "git status" should now say you are on the master branch

        => git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
        nothing to commit, working directory clean

    "git remote -v" should show an "origin" remote with the url of your 
    forked repo.


        | => git remote -v
            origin  https://github.com/blank-blank/data-sci-bowl-2016.git (fetch)

   will show that the files you have modified.

4. Add the files to be commited with the following command:

   git add file_1 path/to/file_2 

   git status will now show these ready for commit

5. commit the files that have been added from the previous step:

   git commit -m "Added svm model. Changed version number."

6. make pull request to origin
